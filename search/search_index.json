We are already working on adding the ability to secure WordOps backend with a letsencrypt SSL certificate. Does Nginx-wo support TLSv1.3 ? \u00b6 Yes, since the release v3.9.5.4, our Nginx package for Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/19.04 and for Debian 10 (buster) is compiled with OpenSSL 1.1.1c and support TLSv1.3.

Proxy site \u00b6 To create site with Proxy configuration you can use --proxy during site creation wo site create site.tld --proxy = 127 .0.0.1:3000 This will create proxy site site.tld with proxy destination as 127.0.0.1:3000. Port is optional. Default port: 80.

If not defined it will take git user name. Define WordPress administrator password \u00b6 To define WordPress administrator password during site creation use wo site create site.tld --pass = password This will set defined password as administrator password. If not defined it will generate random pasword for administrator. If you have special characters, you can quote them using single quotes like this: --pass = 'my$secret&' Define WordPress administrator email \u00b6 To define WordPress administrator email during site creation use wo site create site.tld --email = wo@site.tld This will set defined email as administrator email. If not defined it will set git email as administrator email. Virtual host only \u00b6 To create WordPress site and database without installing it, you can use --vhostonly during site creation For example, you can only create vhost and database without installing WordPress using following command: wo site create site.tld --wp --vhostonly Additional features \u00b6 Let's Encrypt \u00b6 WordOps supports Let's Encrypt out of the box. Domain \u00b6 wo site create site.tld --wp --letsencrypt This command will issue a certificate for site.tld + www.site.tld . Subdomain \u00b6 You can also issue Let's Encrypt certificates with subdomains. wo site create sub.site.tld --wp --letsencrypt Since the release v3.9.8.4 , WordOps will automatically detect if the site is a domain or a subdomain, and will not issue a certificate for www alias with subdomains Wildcard \u00b6 Since the release v3.9.6 , WordOps supports Let's Encrypt Wildcard SSL certificates with DNS API validation. Before issuing a wildcard certificate, it require to define the DNS API crendentials for acme.sh. Example with Cloudflare DNS: export CF_Key = \"d7eab56a903f25dd4xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" export CF_Email = \"email@domain.com\" Info More example in our guide about DNS API configuration After you define those variables with the command export , you can issue your certificate with wo site create site.tld --wp --letsencrypt = wildcard --dns = dns_cf --dns=dns_cf can be replaced with another DNS provider supported by acme.sh. For DigitalOcean, it would be --dns=dns_dgon HSTS \u00b6 Additionally you can enable HSTS on your site by adding the flag --hsts with --letsencrypt wo site create site.tld --wp --letsencrypt --hsts PHP 7.3 & PHP 7.4 \u00b6 To create site with PHP 7.3 you can use --php73 during site creation For example, you can create WordPress site running on PHP 7.3 using following command: wo site create site.tld --wp --php73 For a WordPress site running on PHP 7.4: wo site create site.tld --wp --php74 To create simple php site running with PHP 7.3 with no database, you can use this command: wo site create site.tld --php73 This is the same with PHP 7.4: wo site create site.tld --php74 site update \u00b6 Update site configuration Pre-update policy \u00b6 wo site update command follows following procedure while updating current site. Before Updating any site: Creates nginx configuration backup for site. Moves htdocs to backup while updating HTML/PHP/MySQL site. Creates database dump in backup. While updating current MySQL site WordOps uses same database for installing WordPress tables. All these backup are stored outside htdocs, in backup directory.

Your public ssh key should be available in the directory ~/.ssh/ ( /root/.ssh/ if you are logged in as root ) Add SSH Public key to OLD-SRV \u00b6 You can use the following command to automatically add the public SSH Key to the server : ssh-copy-id root@192.168.0.1 Otherwise, you can still display the public ssh-key with the command cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub and copy it manually in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the other server. SSH Login without password \u00b6 You should now be able to login from the server where you generated the SSH Keys to the other one without password : ssh root@192.168.0.1 SSH Alias and config \u00b6 If you prefer to use an alias to login to OLD-SRV rather than using the IP, or if you want to define a custom SSH port, you just have to create/edit the file ~/.ssh/config and to define settings this way : Host OLD-SRV Hostname 192 .168.0.1 Port 12345 Then you will be able to login with : ssh root@OLD-SRV or even with ssh OLD-SRV Transfer files from OLD-SRV to NEW-SRV \u00b6 To safely migrate files from OLD-SRV to NEW-SRV, we will use rsync because it's fast and secure (files transfer is done over SSH). If you have configured password-less SSH login with the previous steps, and defined an alias into ~/.ssh/config you can use the following command to copy files from OLD-SRV to NEW-SRV rsync -avzh --progress --ignore-existing \\ root@OLD-SRV:/var/www/mydomain.tld/htdocs/ \\ /var/www/mydomain.tld/htdocs/ If you haven't created the file ~/.ssh/config and use custom SSH ports, you can define SSH port with rsync by using the following command : rsync -avzh -e \"ssh -p 12345\" \\ --progress --ignore-existing \\ root@old_server_IP:/var/www/mydomain.tld/htdocs/ \\ /var/www/mydomain.tld/htdocs/ Do not copy the file wp-config.php \u00b6 With WordOps or EasyEngine v3, wp-config.php default path is /var/www/mydomain.tld . If you moved it into htdocs directory, it was probably transfered with rsync during the previous step.

So you just have to create basic site with the arguments --letsencrypt or -le to secure the backend. Example : if your server hostname is properly configured (read below), you can use : wo site create server.domain.tld -le Then you will be able to access to the backend with the adress : https://server.domain.tld:22222 Proper server hostname configuration Server hostname isn't only a name, it's the server public identity on the network. If your server is directly connected to internet(not behind a NAT), it should have a valid hostname. A valid hostname should looks like : myservername.yourdomain.tld myservername is the server name yourdomain.tld is one of your domains To edit hostname properly, use the command : hostnamectl set-hostname <yourserver.hostname.tld> To apply the new hostname, a reboot is required. The last step and the most important, you should create the proper DNS records to make the subdomain myservername.yourdomain.tld pointing to your server IP. Using another certificate \u00b6 Secure WordOps backend with the same certificate than another site \u00b6 If you already have a site secured with Let's Encrypt, you just have to copy the ssl.conf file stored in /var/www/site.tld/conf/nginx .

Example : if your server hostname is properly configured (read below), you can use : wo site create server.domain.tld -le Then you will be able to access to the backend with the adress : https://server.domain.tld:22222 Proper server hostname configuration Server hostname isn't only a name, it's the server public identity on the network. If your server is directly connected to internet(not behind a NAT), it should have a valid hostname. A valid hostname should looks like : myservername.yourdomain.tld myservername is the server name yourdomain.tld is one of your domains To edit hostname properly, use the command : hostnamectl set-hostname <yourserver.hostname.tld> To apply the new hostname, a reboot is required.
